Loops help us repeat instruction in code
for example if we have to print the numbers from 1 to 100.
one way we can do this is by copying and pasting the codee which is bad and not scalable
other way of doing this is using loops.
There are 4 types of loops;
1) while
2)do while
3) for loop
4) enhanced for loop
